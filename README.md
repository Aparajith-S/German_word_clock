# German_text_clock
This is a hardware+software project made as a gift to a friend. 

## Introduction
this is a fun project that is a combination of a novel way to display time and packaging it robustly to make it function as a desk clock.

## Hardware
This is a project intended to run on an embedded target. The target here is an Arduino Nano every. The hardware is chosen so that it can be easily packaged as well as serves as a power supply to the clock.

Requires 
Hardware
- 1 x Arduino Nano Every
- 1 x DS3231 real time clock
- 1 x cr2032 coin cell battery
- 1 x 74HC4067 16 channel analog/digital multiplexer
- 1 x 15x20 cm single side dot board 
- 100 x green(recommended) diffused LEDs. do not use clear LEDs as they are too bright for this project!
- 30 x 1k Ohm resistors 
- 10 x 330 ohm resistors
- [loose components](https://amzn.eu/d/htS7Kq4)
- some wires and a soldering kit.

Housing
- 20x20 picture frame with a 3cm depth for packaging. [link](https://amzn.eu/d/8aUODaw)

## Steps:
1. Preparing the Display.
2. Preparing the connector board.
3. Preparing the main controller board.
4. Packaging the clock.
5. set the clock using a windows application > link!

### Preparing the Display
The Display is the corner stone of this project. There were a lot of challenges along the way to make it work pleasing the eye.  

1. using the template in doc, take a print of the sheet in A4 paper without changing the borders while printing.  
2. paste the sheet on a black A4 chart. black offers the best contrast to any of the colors of the LED that would be chosen.
3. using an exactor knife carve the letters out so that later on, light can illuminate the carved letter.
