# German_word_clock
This is a hardware+software project made as a gift to a friend. 


## Introduction
this is a fun project that is a combination of a novel way to display time and packaging it robustly to make it function as a desk clock.

## Hardware
This is a project intended to run on an embedded target. The target here is an Arduino Nano every. The hardware is chosen so that it can be easily packaged as well as serves as a power supply to the clock.

Requires 
Hardware
1 x Arduino Nano Every
1 x DS3231 real time clock
1 x cr2032 coin cell battery
3 x 74HC4051 multiplexer
1 x 15x20 cm single side dot board 
100 x green diffused LEDs
30 x 1k Ohm resistors 
5 x 330 ohm resistors
